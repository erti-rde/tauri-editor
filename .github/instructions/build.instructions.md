# Instructions for Copilot: Using `llm.md` from llm-context Folders

This project contains three different LLM (Large Language Model) instruction files, each tailored for a specific framework. These files are located in their respective framework folders:

- [tailwind](./llm-context/tailwind.llm.md)
- [svelte](./llm-context/svelte.llm.md)
- [tauri](./llm-context/tauri.llm.md)
- [bits-ui](./llm-context/bits-ui.llm.md)

## How to Use

1. **Identify the Framework**  
  Determine which framework and tools you are working with: Tailwind, Svelte, Tauri, or Bits UI.

2. **Locate the Correct `*.llm.md`**  
  Navigate to the corresponding folder under `llm-context/` and read the `llm.md` file for that framework.

3. **Follow the Instructions**  
  Each `llm.md` file contains documentation, guidelines and best practices for integrating and using LLMs with that tool. Read and follow the instructions provided in the file.
